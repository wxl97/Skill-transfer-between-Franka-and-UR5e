# franka_interactive_controllers

Control interface built on top of [franka_ros](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/franka_ros.html) that allows to control the franka robot arm in several joint and Cartesian space impedance control schemes for interactive, safe and reactive (mostly DS-based) motion planning and learning. This low-level control interface is used and developed by/for [Prof. Nadia Figueroa](https://github.com/nbfigueroa) and her collaborators and students. Initially developed at MIT in the [Interactive Robotics Group](https://interactive.mit.edu/) continued development at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/).

## Installation
Besides [franka_ros](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/franka_ros.html) and by consequence [libfranka](https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka) this package depends on several other code repositories that are robot-agnostic and useful for control and learning of motion policies from demonstrations. 

To install this repo and all its dependencies do the following steps:
* In your catkin src directory clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers.git
```
* wstool gets all other git repository dependencies, after the following steps you should see extra catkin 
  packages in your src directory.
```
$  wstool init
$  wstool merge franka_interactive_controllers/dependencies.rosinstall 
$  wstool up 
```
* Query and installs all libraries and packages 
```
$ rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro <your-ros-distro> 
```

* Install some additional python dependencies
```
$ sudo apt install python3-psutil python3-tkinter
```

* Finally complie
```bash
  $ cd ~/catkin_ws
  $ catkin_make
  $ source devel/setup.bash
  $ catkin_make
  $ rospack profile
```
 You might need to source the `./bashrc` file and compile again if the first compliation could not find some of the in-house dependencies. If `roscd` doesn't find the compiled packages run `rospack profile`.

## Instructions

We include a list of [instructions](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/doc/instructions/README.md) for using the franka panda arm with this controller package:
- [Startup the robot](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/doc/instructions/robot_startup.md)
- [External tool compensation](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/doc/instructions/external_tool_compensation.md) (necessary if your experiment requires mounting a tool/accesory on the franka hand)
- [Basic robot operating functionalities](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/doc/instructions/basic_robot_control.md) (open/close gripper and move robot to a desired joint position bypassing franka_ros -- useful to startup an experiment).
- [Kinesthetic Teaching + Data Collection and Pre-Processing](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/doc/instructions/kinesthetic_teaching_recording.md)
- [Learning DS motion policies](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/doc/instructions/ds_learning.md)
- [Executing DS motion policies](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/doc/instructions/executing_ds.md)
- Executing custom motion policies (MPC, feed-forward NN, DMP, etc)

## Usage
Following we detail instructions on how to bringup the controllers and their functionalities:   

### Main Robot Launch
To bring up the standalone robot with [franka_ros](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/franka_ros.html) without any specific controller (useful for testing -- can be included in your custom launch file):
```bash
roslaunch franka_interactive_controllers franka_interactive_bringup.launch 
```
This will load all franka_ros (franka_control, franka_gripper, etc.) functionalities + gripper GUI controller + configured rviz settings.

</p>

### Robot Controllers
#### Joint Gravity Compensation
To load the [joint gravity compensation controller](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/src/franka_joint_controllers/joint_gravity_compensation_controller.cpp) launch the following:
```bash
roslaunch franka_interactive_controllers joint_gravity_compensation_controller.launch
```
  - This will load a joint gravity compensation torque controller. It compensates (from code) the weight of any additional tool (i.e., a tool grasped by the hand or cameras mounted on the gripper). As well as the capability to lock certain joints for ease of demonstration. 
  - The external forces imposed on the end-effector with the additional weight should be defined in ``./config/external_tool_compensation.yaml``. Instructions on how to finding values for your custom tool [here](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/doc/instructions/external_tool_compensation.md). You can toggle to **activate/deactivate** this compensation online using dynamic reconfigure. Default is set to ``true``.
  - The desired joints to lock and the locked positions can be modified online by dynamic reconfigure. Default is set to ``false`` for all locks.
  - To launch ``franka_interactive_bringup.launch`` within this same launch file ``set load_franka_control:=true``. Default is set to ``false``.

      <img src="doc/img/franka_joint_gravity_compensation.png" width="700x"> 
  </p>

**NOTE: If you run this script and the robot moves by itself, that means that your external_tool_compensation forces are incorrect. See external_tool_compensation instructions to correct it.** 

#### Kinesthetic Teaching/Recording Pipeline
You can launch the [joint gravity compensation controller](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/src/franka_joint_controllers/joint_gravity_compensation_controller.cpp) together with data recording nodes from my [easy-kinesthetic-teaching](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/easy-kinesthetic-recording) repository ``latest-franka`` branch. 

```bash
roslaunch franka_interactive_controllers franka_kinesthetic_teaching.launch
```

If you installed and compiled everything correctly you should see the following windows on your screen:
<p align="center">
    <img src="doc/img/franka_kinesthetic_teaching.png" width="800x"> 
</p> 


This will run scripts and nodes that will allow you to:
- Select topics to record and define path to save rosbags.
- Run all functionalities from [joint gravity compensation controller](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/src/franka_joint_controllers/joint_gravity_compensation_controller.cpp).
- Bringup rosservice to record/stop a recording.
- Visualize end-effector trajectories being recorded in real-time and gripper state (open/closed).
- Replay recorded end-effector trajectoriers and gripper state in RViz, franka controllers and launch files must be turned off for this functionality.

See [Kinesthetic Teaching/Recording](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/doc/instructions/kinesthetic_teaching_recording.md) instructions for definitions and usage.


#### Cartesian Impedance Controller with Pose Command
To load a cartesian impedance controller with pose command (a PD control law with position error tracking; i.e., **stiffness control** and velocity damping) launch the following:
```bash
roslaunch franka_interactive_controllers cartesian_pose_impedance_controller.launch
```
This launch file will load a ``cartesian impedance controller`` that:
- Takes as input a desired end-effector pose (position and orientation) as a ``geometry_msg::PoseStamped`` with topic name ``/cartesian_impedance_controller/desired_pose``.
- Will compensate for external forces imposed by additional tools/accesories mounted on the gripper (as described in joint gravity compensation controller above).
- Control for a desired nullspace configuration, defined in  [config/impedance_control_additional_params.yaml](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/config/impedance_control_additional_params.yaml), stiffness for nullspace control can be modified online by dynamic reconfigure.

#### Cartesian Impedance Controller with Twist Command
To load a cartesian impedance controller with twist command (a PD control law with position and velocity error tracking) launch the following:
```bash
roslaunch franka_interactive_controllers cartesian_twist_impedance_controller.launch
```
This launch file will load a ``cartesian impedance controller`` that:
- Takes as input a desired end-effector twist (linear and angular velocity) as a ``geometry_msg::Twist`` with topic name ``/cartesian_impedance_controller/desired_twist``.
- Will compensate for external forces imposed by additional tools/accesories mounted on the gripper (as described in joint gravity compensation controller above).
- Control for a desired nullspace configuration, defined in  [config/impedance_control_additional_params.yaml](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers/blob/main/config/impedance_control_additional_params.yaml), stiffness for nullspace control can be modified online by dynamic reconfigure.
